    <h3>Projects</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Automated Design rule checker for VLSI circuits using Machine Learning
            <br> <strong>Keys skills: Machine Learning | VLSI | Microwind | Python </strong> <br>
            Developed an efficient method which uses CNN model for efficient identification of DRC Violations for a
            selected
            VLSI circuit D-Flip Flop. We have trained models for hundreds of images we have collected by preparing a
            dataset
            with the help of microwind tool. The goal of this project is to present a new method for implementing DRC
            that is
            based on the CNN model technology.

        <li>MyBlog website <br>
            <strong> Keys skills: Python | Django | Html | CSS | Javascript | Bootstrap </strong><br>
            MyBlog website is made using Django framework. The website is Dynamic and Responsive. Different features are
            added to website like user can view the blog posted on the website and also read more about a particular
            topic.

        <br>
        <li>Food Billing System <br>
            <strong>Keys skills: Java | Java swing | OOPS concepts</strong><br>
            The main objective of this project is to develop an application for food billing system which enable user to
            add
            the
            item that he/she wants to buy and view the total cost and check the balance.
        </li>
        <br>

        <li>Development of Fault Equivalence concept <br>
            <strong>Keys skills: Java | Testing of Digital Circuits</strong><br>
            In this project a generic algorithm for the implementation of fault Equivalence concept was made using Java.
            The
            algorithm was used to apply fault Equivalence on C - 17 Benchmark circuit. The algorithm would also
            calculate
            the
            collapse ratio.
